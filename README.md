This is a simple CRUD test application using:

- Blazor Server
- .Net Core 3.0 SDK
- Dapper.Contrib (For the database operations)
- SQL Server 2016 Developer (Service Broker enabled)
- SqlTableDependency (To listen to database changes and refresh the clients connected through events triggered from the Service layer)
